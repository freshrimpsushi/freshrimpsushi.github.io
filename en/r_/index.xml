      <description>Definition 1 Set: A collection of distinct objects that serves as the subject of our intuition or thought is called a set. Element: An object belonging to a set is called an element. Propositional Function: For an element $x$ in the set $U$, a proposition $p(x)$ that is either true or false is referred to as a propositional function on $U$. Explanation In mathematics, the concept of sets is nearly</description>

      <description>Definition 1 A statement that is either true or false is called a proposition. Propositions have a single truth value â€“ either true or false. If the truth values of two propositions $p$ and $q$ are the same, then $p$ and $q$ are said to be logically equivalent, denoted as $p \equiv q$. The following symbols are used as connectives to form compound propositions: Negation: $\lnot$ Conjunction: $\land$ Disjunction: $\lor$</description>

      <description>Formula $$ d=\frac { |2k| }{ \sqrt { m^{ 2 }+1 } } $$ Explanation When solving problems related to finding the tangent of a quadratic curve, there is often a need to determine the distance between two tangents. While there is a formula for finding the distance between a point and a line, it is not inherently difficult. However, knowing a formula that can quickly and easily calculate this</description>
