[{"categories":"집합론","contents":"Definition 1 Set: A collection of distinct objects that serves as the subject of our intuition or thought is called a set. Element: An object belonging to a set is called an element. Propositional Function: For an element $x$ in the set $U$, a proposition $p(x)$ that is either true or false is referred to as a propositional function on $U$. Explanation In mathematics, the concept of sets is nearly as fundamental as a native language. Perhaps what makes it even better than natural language is its ability to eliminate inherent ambiguity and allow logical reasoning based solely on its definition and form. Typically, elements are represented in lowercase, and sets in uppercase. If $a$ belongs to $A$, it is written as $a \\in A$, and we say \u0026ldquo;$a$ is an element of $A$.\u0026rdquo; Of course, there is no strict requirement to represent elements and sets with alphabetic uppercase and lowercase, and it is common to denote the set of all natural numbers as $\\mathbb{N}$, where $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ would also be acceptable. Enumeration: The set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ can be expressed as $\\left\\{1, 2, 3, \\cdots \\right\\}$. This representation, where the elements of the set are explicitly listed, is called enumeration. Set-Builder Notation: In contrast to enumeration, a set can also be represented as the collection of elements that satisfy certain conditions. For example, if we want to represent the set of natural numbers greater than $5$, we can express it as $\\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{N} : x \u0026gt; 5 \\right\\}$. This notation is known as set-builder notation or conditional specification. It is important to note that a propositional function is defined by the proposition function itself. Although it conforms to the definition of a function in set theory, it is crucial to recognize that it can be defined solely in terms of propositions, without depending on set theory. This clarity is essential to avoid difficulties in freely using set-builder notation, as circular definitions of functions could arise if this aspect is unclear. Additionally, propositional functions are also referred to as logical expressions. Heung-Chun Lee, You-Feng Lin. (2011).

Propositions have a single truth value – either true or false. If the truth values of two propositions $p$ and $q$ are the same, then $p$ and $q$ are said to be logically equivalent, denoted as $p \\equiv q$. The following symbols are used as connectives to form compound propositions:\nNegation: $\\lnot$ Conjunction: $\\land$ Disjunction: $\\lor$ Conditional: $\\to$ Biconditional: $\\leftrightarrow$ Truth Table Usually, true is represented by $T$, and false by $F$. The truth values of propositions formed by applying the connectives can be conveniently verified using a truth table:\nNegation If $p$ is true, then $\\lnot p$ is false, and if $p$ is false, then $\\lnot p$ is true.\n$\\text{NOT}$ gate Conjunction If both $p$ and $q$ are true, then $p \\land q$ is true; otherwise, it is false. In fields like computer engineering, $0$ is often considered false, and any non-zero number is considered true. Considering two non-zero numbers $a$ and $b$, $a \\times b = ab \\ne 0$ is true, but if either $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then $a \\times b = 0$ is false. In this sense, $\\land$ is called logical \u0026lsquo;AND\u0026rsquo;.\n$\\text{AND}$ gate Disjunction If at least one of $p$ and $q$ is true, then $p \\lor q$ is true; it is false only when both are false. Similar to conjunction, $\\lor$ is called logical \u0026lsquo;OR\u0026rsquo;. Of course, if $b = -a \\ne 0$, then $a$ and $b$ are both true, but $a+b = 0$ is false. Let\u0026rsquo;s not dwell on this exception; it\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026rsquo;logical OR\u0026rsquo; and not just \u0026lsquo;OR\u0026rsquo;.\n$\\text{OR}$ gate Conditional If $p$ is true and $q$ is true, then $p \\to q$ is true. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that, contrary to natural language, if $p$ is false, $p \\to q$ is true regardless of the truth value of $q$. Additionally, $p \\to q \\equiv \\lnot p \\lor q$, which can be easily proven through a truth table. Refer to the bottom of the main text.\nBiconditional If both $p \\to q$ and $q \\to p$ are true, then $p \\leftrightarrow q$ is true. In mathematical notation, $(p \\to q) \\land (q \\to p) \\equiv p \\leftrightarrow q$. In terms of a truth table, $p \\leftrightarrow q$ is true only when $p$ and $q$ have the same truth value.\nProof of Conditional Based on the definitions of negation and disjunction:\n■\nHeung-Chun Lee, You-Feng Lin.

While there is a formula for finding the distance between a point and a line, it is not inherently difficult. However, knowing a formula that can quickly and easily calculate this distance can help reduce computational effort.\nDerivation Let\u0026rsquo;s consider the equations of two parallel lines as $y=mx\\pm k$. The distance between an arbitrary point $(x,y)$ and the line $y=mx+k$ is given by $$ \\frac { |mx-y+k| }{ \\sqrt { m^{ 2 }+1 } } $$ Expressing this for a point $(x_{1},y_{1})$ on the line $y=mx-k$ gives $$ k=mx_{1}-y_{1} $$ Substituting $mx_{1}-y_{1}=k$ into the distance formula, we get $$ {{ |mx_{1}-y_{1}+k| }\\over{ \\sqrt { m^{ 2 }+1 } }} = {{ |k+k| }\\over{\\sqrt { m^{ 2 }+1 }}} $$ Therefore, the distance between the parallel lines $y=mx\\pm k$ is $$ \\frac { |2k| }{ \\sqrt { m^{ 2 }+1 } } $$\n■\n","id":4,"permalink":"https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/derivation-of-formula-for-distance-of-two-parallel-lines/","tags":null,"title":"Deriving the formula for finding the distance between two parallel lines"}]
