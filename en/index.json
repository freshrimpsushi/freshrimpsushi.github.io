While there is a formula for finding the distance between a point and a line, it is not inherently difficult. However, knowing a formula that can quickly and easily calculate this distance can help reduce computational effort.\nDerivation Let\u0026rsquo;s consider the equations of two parallel lines as $y=mx\\pm k$. The distance between an arbitrary point $(x,y)$ and the line $y=mx+k$ is given by $$ \\frac { |mx-y+k| }{ \\sqrt { m^{ 2 }+1 } } $$ Expressing this for a point $(x_{1},y_{1})$ on the line $y=mx-k$ gives $$ k=mx_{1}-y_{1} $$ Substituting $mx_{1}-y_{1}=k$ into the distance formula, we get $$ {{ |mx_{1}-y_{1}+k| }\\over{ \\sqrt { m^{ 2 }+1 } }} = {{ |k+k| }\\over{\\sqrt { m^{ 2 }+1 }}} $$ Therefore, the distance between the parallel lines $y=mx\\pm k$ is $$ \\frac { |2k| }{ \\sqrt { m^{ 2 }+1 } } $$\n■\n","id":4,"permalink":"https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/derivation-of-formula-for-distance-of-two-parallel-lines/","tags":null,"title":"평행한 두 직선 사이의 거리를 구하는 공식 유도"}]
