      <description>Definition 1 For a non-empty subset $A,B \subset \mathbb{C}$ of the set of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, $f : A \to B$ is called a Complex Valued Function. On the other hand, when $A, B \subset \mathbb{R}$, $f : A \to B$ is also referred to as a Real Valued Function to distinguish it from complex functions. Explanation The above definition actually means nothing. You might wonder what all this is</description>

      <description>Overview We introduce definitions for dealing with the set of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ as a topological space. Although it is referred to as a topological space, most of the definitions are specializations of the definitions in a metric space for complex sets. If you have studied introductory analysis diligently, you will be able to understand these without much difficulty. Definitions 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s assume $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$, $\delta &amp;gt; 0$ and</description>

      <description>Definition 1 $$ g(t) := p(t) + i q(t) \qquad , t \in [a,b] $$ Let&amp;rsquo;s assume for a real function $p, q : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, a complex function $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{C}$ is expressed as above. The definite integral from $[a,b]$ to $g$ is defined as follows. $$ \int_{a}^{b} g(t) dt = \int_{a}^{b} p(t) dt + i \int_{a}^{b} q(t) dt $$ For $t \in [a,b]$, the complex</description>

      <description>Definition 1 $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ being a zero of order $n$ of the function $f : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ means that for some function $g$, where $\displaystyle \lim_{z \to \alpha} g(z) \ne 0$, it can be expressed as follows: $$ f(z) = (z-\alpha)^{n} g(z) $$ Theorem Zeros are isolated: For a zero $f$, we can take a radius such that no other zeros exist around it. For the zero $\alpha$</description>

      <description>Definition 1 The solution $x = \sqrt{-1}$ of the quadratic equation $x^{2} +1 = 0$ is called an Imaginary Number. A number in the form of $z = x + iy$ for two real numbers $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ is called a Complex Number, and is also denoted as $(x,y)$. Here, $\text{Re} (z) = x$ and $\text{Im} (z) = y$ are called the Real Part and Imaginary Part of $z$, respectively.</description>

      <description>Definition Given open sets $A \subset \mathbb{C}$ and $f: A \to \mathbb{C}$, let us assume $\alpha \in A$. If $\displaystyle \lim_{z \to \alpha } f(z) = f (\alpha)$, then $f$ is said to be continuous at $\alpha$, and if $f$ is continuous at every point in the complex domain $\mathscr{R}$, then $f$ is said to be continuous on $\mathscr{R}$. Especially, if $f$ is continuous throughout its domain, it is called</description>

      <description>Definition 1 A function $f: A \subset \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ that is analytic at $\mathscr{R} \subset A$ and for all $z \in \mathscr{R}$ satisfies $f &#39; (z) \ne 0$ is called a Conformal Mapping if $f$. Meanwhile, if there exists a point $\alpha$ that satisfies $f &#39; (\alpha) = 0$, then $\alpha$ is referred to as the Critical Point of $f$.

      <description>Theorem 1 Let the analytic function $f: A \subset \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ have a finite number of singularities $z_{1} , z_{2} , \cdots , z_{m}$ inside a simple closed path $\mathscr{C}$. Then, $$ \int_{\mathscr{C}} f(z) dz = 2 \pi i \sum_{k=1}^{m} \text{Res}_{z_{k}} f(z) $$ Explanation At first glance, the theorem might seem quite confusing. One has to calculate the integral, but instead of calculus-like computations, there&amp;rsquo;s talk about singularities and</description>

      <description>Buildup Taylor&amp;rsquo;s theorem generalizes the mean value theorem regarding the number of differentiations. It expands from dealing with something differentiated $1$ times to $n \in \mathbb{N}$ times. But if it was possible to generalize it to natural numbers, could it not be generalized to all integers? Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to differentiate $-n$ times, but what about considering integration, which is the inverse operation of differentiation? Here we introduce</description>

      <description>Definitions Singularity 1 If the function $f$ is differentiable at all points of $\mathcal{N}(\alpha)$ in $\alpha$, it is said to be analytic at $\alpha$. If the function $f$ is not analytic in $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ but is analytic at some points of $\mathcal{N}(\alpha)$, $\alpha$ is called a Singular Point of $f$. If there exists $\mathcal{N}(\alpha)$ that is analytic at all points except for $\alpha$, then $\alpha$ is said to be</description>

      <description>Definition Let&amp;rsquo;s define a complex number as $z$ with $z=a+ib(a,b\in \mathbb{R})$. $\overline{z}$ is defined as follows and is called the Complex Conjugate of $z$. $$ \overline{z}:=\overline{a+ib}=a-ib $$ Explanation It can be explained as substituting $-i$ for $i$ in the original complex number, and as a reflection across the real axis on the complex plane. The term conjugate seems to be named because it forms a pair that produces a real</description>

      <description>Theorem 1 $n$th degree polynomial $P(x) = a_{0} + a_{1} x + a_{2} x^2 + \cdots + a_{n} x^{n}$ has exactly $n$ roots, including multiple roots. Explanation In fact, when we solve a polynomial, we usually assume that there exists a solution, but there&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee that this is always the case. For example, the quadratic polynomial $x^2+1 = 0$ does not have real roots. However, if complex numbers are</description>

If a simple closed path $\mathscr{C} \subset \mathscr{R}$ contained in $\mathscr{R}$ surrounds a point $\alpha$, then the following holds: $$ f(\alpha) = {{1} \over {2 \pi i }} \int_{\mathscr{C}} {{f(z)} \over { z - \alpha }} dz $$ Derivation First, let&amp;rsquo;s show that $\displaystyle 2 \pi i = \int_{\mathscr{C} &#39;}</description>
