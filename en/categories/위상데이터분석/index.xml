      <description>Overview This section explains and implements the pseudocode of an algorithm introduced in the paper &amp;ldquo;Computing Persistent Homology&amp;rdquo; by Zomorodian and Carlsson1. It takes a filtered complex constructed from an abstract simplicial complex and returns $\mathcal{P}$-intervals, omitting the construction of computationally challenging persistent modules and calculating persistent homology through matrix reduction. Furthermore, the actual implementation does not even use matrix operations. Derivation Derivation of Zomorodian&amp;rsquo;s algorithm: It&amp;rsquo;s certain that without</description>

      <description>Overview The paper &amp;ldquo;Computing Persistent Homology&amp;rdquo; by Zomorodian and Carlsson introduces an algorithm for deriving $\mathcal{P}$-intervals from a Filtered Complex created by an Abstract Simplicial Complex, bypassing the construction of Persistent Modules that are challenging to handle computationally, and computing persistent homology through matrix reduction1. Derivation Part 0. Preliminary Investigation The derivation of the algorithm starts by examining the form of a Persistence Complex depicted as above, crucial for understanding</description>

      <description>Theorem 1 2 Definitions of Covering and Lifting: Let&amp;rsquo;s denote the unit interval as $I = [0,1]$. An open set $U \subset X$ of $X$ is evenly covered by $p$ if for every $\alpha \in \forall$, all corresponding restricted functions $p |_{\widetilde{U}_{\alpha}}$ are homeomorphisms, and $$ \alpha_{1} \ne \alpha_{2} \implies \widetilde{U}_{\alpha_{1}} \cap \widetilde{U}_{\alpha_{2}} = \emptyset $$ holds, meaning there exist disjoint open sets $\widetilde{U}_{\alpha} \subset \widetilde{X}$ in $\widetilde{X}$ such that</description>

      <title>Betti Number of Homology Group</title>

      <description>Overview Without considering the geometric meaning, if we just define it plainly, in Algebraic Topology, the Betti Number is merely the rank of the homology group in a chain complex. The problem is that such an explanation does not help those curious about the meaning of Betti numbers, and it&amp;rsquo;s also difficult to learn through examples because the specific calculation is daunting. In this post, we introduce a theorem that</description>

      <description>Problem Smallest Enclosing Disk Let&amp;rsquo;s denote it as $n &amp;gt; d$. In a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, given a finite set $P = \left\{ p_{k} \right\}_{k=1}^{n} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$, the following optimization problem is referred to as the Smallest Enclosing Disk Problem: $$ \begin{matrix} \text{Minimize} &amp;amp; r \ge 0 \\ \text{subject to} &amp;amp; \left\| c - p_{k} \right\|_{2} \le r \end{matrix} \\ c \in \mathbb{R}^{d} , k = 1, \cdots , n</description>

      <description>Buildup Despite the complexity of the content, I made sure to leave detailed calculations and explanations to make it as understandable as possible. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in homology, I highly recommend reading this. Consider a topological space $X$ of interest, represented through a $\Delta$-complex structure according to a specific simplicial complex. As a small example, in the image on the right, the torus represents $X$, and the left side corresponds</description>
