      <description>Definition The following five bases are referred to as the Canonical Bases: Purine bases: Adenine $A$, Guanine $G$ Pyrimidine bases: Cytosine $C$, Thymine $T$, Uracil $U$ Description Thymine is only used in DNA, while Uracil is used in RNA. Therefore, by checking whether $T$ or $U$ is used in the data, one can tell whether it is a DNA or RNA base sequence. A Base Pair is formed by two</description>

      <description>Build-up A polymer is a large molecule composed of repeating monomeric units linked by chemical synthesis. Phosphoric Acid is a type of inorganic oxyacid, with the chemical formula $H_{3}PO_{4}$. A monosaccharide with five carbon atoms is called Pentose. The molecule that functions as the basic unit of genetic information is known as a Nitrogenous base or simply Base. A nucleotide is a molecule that consists of phosphate-pentose-base and becomes the</description>

      <description>Buildup Polymers are high molecular compounds formed by the repeating connection of monomers through chemical synthesis. Phosphoric Acid is a type of inorganic oxyacid, with the chemical formula $H_{3}PO_{4}$. Monosaccharides with five carbon atoms are called Pentoses. Molecules that function as the basic unit of genetic information are called Nitrogenous bases, or simply Bases. A molecule composed of phosphate, pentose, and a base, serving as the building block of nucleic</description>

      <description>Definition Greedy algorithm is a method of making choices that only considers the current moment and selects the best possible option. Description As its name suggests, the greedy algorithm focuses on the immediate without taking a long-term perspective. Speaking positively, it&amp;rsquo;s always trying to do its best, but this may not always be wise when looking at the bigger picture. Consider the following example: Let&amp;rsquo;s say there&amp;rsquo;s a problem of</description>

      <description>Buildup When solving a problem, if the solution to a larger problem includes the solution to a smaller problem, it is said to have an Optimal Substructure. An easy example of a problem with an optimal substructure is calculating the Fibonacci numbers. The $n$-th Fibonacci number is calculated as $a_{n} = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$, thus, the larger problem $a_{n}$ includes the smaller problems $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n-2}$. A simple way to</description>

      <description>Definition The time it takes to solve a given problem is called time complexity, and the memory requirements are referred to as space complexity. Example Asymptotic notation is a very useful means for expressing these. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at an example of time complexity. Constant Time $O(1)$ Algorithms that can finish regardless of $n$, essentially taking no time. For example, finding the third element in $\mathbb{x} = [4,3,8,-1,-9,0,5,7,2,6]$ just</description>
