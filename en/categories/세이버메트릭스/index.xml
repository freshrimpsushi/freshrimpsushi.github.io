The expected winning percentage of the season for this team $p$ is as follows. $$ p = {{ S^{2} } \over { S^{2} + A^{2} }} = {{ 1 } \over { 1 + (A/S)^{2} }} $$ Explanation The Pythagorean Expectation, proposed by Bill James, is a nonlinear model that uses</description></item><item><title>Definition of OPS in Baseball</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/2208/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/2208/</guid><description>Definition 1 The sum of On-base Percentage (OBP) and Slugging Percentage (SLG) is known as OPS. $$ OPS := OBP + SLG $$ Description A high on-base percentage has been considered to increase the expected score for the team, and a high slugging percentage is seen as an indicator of the ability to realize these expectations.
