      <description>Definition The square of the sphere $1$, denoted as $S^{1} \times S^{1} = [0,1] \times [0,1]$, and the quotient space $T$ that is homeomorphic to it according to the map shown above, is called a Torus. In the figure, the donut shape on the far right is an example of a torus. Description The torus is a space - more specifically, a figure - that is treated very preciously throughout</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Let $X$ be a set with two topologies $\mathscr{T}_{1}$, $\mathscr{T}_{2}$. If $\mathscr{T}_{1} \subset \mathscr{T}_{2}$, then $\mathscr{T}_{1}$ is said to be weaker than $\mathscr{T}_{2}$, and $\mathscr{T}_{2}$ is said to be stronger than $\mathscr{T}_{1}$. Consider the set $\mathscr{F} := \left\{ f_{\alpha} : X \hookrightarrow X_{\alpha} , \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \right\}$ of injections from the set $X$ to the topological space $X_{\alpha}$. $$ \mathscr{S} := \left\{ f_{\alpha}^{-1} \left( O_{\alpha} \right) \subset</description>

      <description>Theorems Let us assume that $f : X \to Y$, with $X$ being compact, and $f$ being continuous. [1]: If $f$ is surjective, $Y$ is compact. Even if $f$ is not surjective, $f(X)$ is still compact. [2]: If $Y$ is Hausdorff, then $f$ is a closed function. For a closed set $C \subset X$, $f(C) \subset Y$ is also a closed set.

It is said to have the Finite Intersection Property if for all finite subsets $A \subset \mathscr{A}$, $\displaystyle \bigcap A \ne \emptyset$ implies $A$.

      <description>Definition $X$ is said to be an infinite set. $\mathscr{T}_{f} : = \left\{ \emptyset , X \right\} \cup \left\{ U \subset X : | X \setminus U | &amp;lt; \infty \right\}$ is called the cofinite topology. $\mathscr{T}_{c} : = \left\{ \emptyset , X \right\} \cup \left\{ U \subset X : | X \setminus U | = \aleph_{0} \right\}$ is called the cocountable topology. Aleph null $\aleph_{0}$ refers to the cardinality</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Given a set $X$, providing it with the trivial topology $\left\{ \emptyset , X \right\}$ makes it the smallest space, called the trivial space. Conversely, endowing it with the discrete topology $\mathscr{P}(X)$ makes it the largest space, known as the discrete space. Sierpinski Space If the topology of $S : = \left\{ 0, 1 \right\}$ is $\mathscr{T} : = \left\{ \emptyset , \left\{ 1 \right\} , \left\{ 0,</description>

      <description>Definition 1 For a topological space $X$, let&amp;rsquo;s say $A \subset X$. When an open set $O$ exists that satisfies $x \in O \subset A$, $x$ is called the interior point of $A$. The set of interior points of $A$, $A^{\circ}$, is called the interior of $A$. The union of $A$ and its codomain $\overline{A} : = A \cup a &#39;$ is called the closure of $A$. When $x \in</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s assume a topological space $\left( X , \mathscr{T} \right)$ is given. If for $A \subset X$ any open set $O$ containing $x$ satisfies $O \cap ( A \setminus \left\{ x \right\} ) \ne \emptyset$, then $x$ is called a limit point of $A$, and the set of all limit points of $A$ is called the derived set of $A$. A sequence $\left\{ x_{n} \right\}$ in $X$ converges</description>

      <description>Definition Topological Space 1 Given a set $X$, if $\mathscr{T} \subset \mathscr{P} (X)$ satisfies the following three conditions for $T \in \mathscr{T}$, then $\mathscr{T}$ is called the topology of $X$, and $\left( X , \mathscr{T} \right)$ is called a Topological Space. (i): $$\emptyset , X \in \mathscr{T}$$ (ii): $$\displaystyle \bigcup_{ \alpha \in \forall } T_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{T}$$ (iii): $$\displaystyle \bigcap_{ i= 1}^{n} T_{i} \in \mathscr{T}$$ Explained in words, conditions (i)~(iii)</description>

      <description>Definition1 A topological space $X$ is said to be sequentially compact if every sequence $\left\{ x_{n} \right\}$ in $X$ has a subsequence $\left\{ x_{n_{k}} \right\}$ that converges to a point in $X$. Explanation In general, in topological spaces, compactness and sequential compactness are independent. For example, there are spaces that are compact but not sequentially compact, and vice versa, spaces that are sequentially compact but not compact. In metric spaces,</description>
