      <description>Definition The square of the sphere $1$, denoted as $S^{1} \times S^{1} = [0,1] \times [0,1]$, and the quotient space $T$ that is homeomorphic to it according to the map shown above, is called a Torus. In the figure, the donut shape on the far right is an example of a torus. Description The torus is a space - more specifically, a figure - that is treated very preciously throughout</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Given a metric space $(X,d)$ and $\varepsilon&amp;gt;0$, A finite set $A_{\varepsilon} \subset X$ that satisfies $B_{d}(x,\varepsilon) \cap A_{\varepsilon} \ne \emptyset$ for all $x \in X$ is called a $\varepsilon$-net for $X$. If for all $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, there exists a $\varepsilon$-net $A_{\varepsilon}$ for $X$, then $X$ is said to be Totally Bounded. Explanation Totally bounded spaces are often also called precompact spaces. $\varepsilon$-Net Calling $A_{\varepsilon}$ a net is</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that a topological space $(X,\mathscr{T})$ and a subset $A \subset X$ are given. Then, the following set $$ \mathscr{T}_{A} =\left\{ A\cap U\ :\ U\in \mathscr{T} \right\} $$ is a topology on $A$. In this case, $\mathscr{T}_{A}$ is referred to as the Subspace Topology or Relative Topology. Moreover, the topological space $(A, \mathscr{T}_{A})$ is called the Subspace of $(X,\mathscr{T})$.

      <description>Theorem 1 For a compact space $X$, if a function $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then for every $x \in X$, there exists a $c,d \in X$ that satisfies $f(c) \le f(x) \le f(d)$. Explanation In $\mathbb{R}$, being compact is equivalent to being a closed interval $[a,b]$, so ultimately this generalizes the theorem we learned in high school and analysis.

A continuous function $p : [0,1] \to X$ from initial point $p(0)$ to terminal point $p(1)$ is called a path. $\overline{p}(t) = p(1-t)$ is called the reverse path of $p$. If for every $a,b \in X$ there exists a path $p$ satisfying both $p(0) = a$ and $p(1) = b$, then $X$ is called a path-connected space.</description>
