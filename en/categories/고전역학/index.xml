      <description>Overview Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s principle, functionals, action, and variation are explained here in a way that is as simple as possible. If you have not found a satisfactory explanation elsewhere, it is recommended to read through to the end. This has been written so that even freshmen and sophomores in college can understand it. Lagrangian Mechanics1 When an object moves from time $t_{1}$ to $t_{2}$, the integral of the Lagrangian over the</description>

      <description>Simple Harmonic Motion1 Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the motion of an object hanging on a spring. It oscillates back and forth due to the restoring force of the spring. Such motion is called a harmonic oscillation. The functions representing harmonic oscillation, $\sin$ and $\cos$, were called harmonic functions a long time ago, which is why the motion is designated as such. Among harmonic oscillations, those with no friction or other external forces,</description>
