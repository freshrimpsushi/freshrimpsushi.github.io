      <description>Damped Harmonic Oscillation1 When the spring constant is denoted as $k$, the equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator is as follows. $$ m \ddot {x}+kx=0 $$ The simple harmonic motion only considers the restoring force by the spring. However, in reality, other external forces such as frictional forces also affect the motion of the object, so they cannot be ignored. So, let&amp;rsquo;s assume there is a frictional force</description>

      <description>Law of Universal Gravity1 The law of universal gravity, announced by Newton through his Principia in 1687, is a physical law that simply states &amp;ldquo;every object attracts every other object&amp;rdquo;. To describe this concept in detail: Every particle of matter in the universe with mass attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the</description>

      <description>Angular Momentum1 Momentum is a physical quantity that represents the state of motion of a moving object. The larger the mass and the faster the speed, the greater the momentum. In physics, there is an interest in how the motion of an object changes. Therefore, the force, which is the cause of changing the state of motion of an object, is expressed as a change in momentum. $$ \mathbf{F}=\frac{d \mathbf{p}}{dt}</description>

      <description>Newton&amp;rsquo;s Laws of Motion 1 English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton presented three laws about motion in 1687 in Principia as follows: An object not subjected to an external force does not change its state of motion. The change in motion is proportional to the applied force on the object. When object 1 applies a force to object 2, object 2 simultaneously applies a force equal in magnitude and opposite</description>

      <description>Mass1 In Newton&amp;rsquo;s laws of motion, inertia is described as the property that resists changes in motion. That is, the greater the inertia, the harder it is to move, and the smaller the inertia, the easier it is to move. This exactly aligns with our experience that it&amp;rsquo;s harder to push a heavier object than a lighter one. Hence, the magnitude of inertia can be expressed by the magnitude of</description>

      <description>Definition A system of particles is referred to as a particle system. Description 1 When the position vectors of particles with masses $m_{1}$, $m_2$, $\cdots$, and $m_{n}$ are $\mathbf{r}_{1}$, $\mathbf{r}_{2}$, $\cdots$, and $\mathbf{r}_{n}$, respectively, the center of mass of this particle system is defined as follows. $$ \mathbf{r}_{cm}=\frac{m_{1}\mathbf{r}_{1}+m_{2}\mathbf{r}_{2}+\cdots + m_{n}\mathbf{r}_{n}}{m_{1}+ m_{2}+ \cdots+ m_{n}}=\frac{\sum m_{i}\mathbf{r}_{i}}{m} $$ Here, $m=\sum \limits_{i}m_{i}$ denotes the total mass of the particle system. The subscript $cm$ stands</description>

      <description>Overview Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s principle, functionals, action, and variation are explained here in a way that is as simple as possible. If you have not found a satisfactory explanation elsewhere, it is recommended to read through to the end. This has been written so that even freshmen and sophomores in college can understand it. Lagrangian Mechanics1 When an object moves from time $t_{1}$ to $t_{2}$, the integral of the Lagrangian over the</description>

      <description>Simple Harmonic Motion1 Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the motion of an object hanging on a spring. It oscillates back and forth due to the restoring force of the spring. Such motion is called a harmonic oscillation. The functions representing harmonic oscillation, $\sin$ and $\cos$, were called harmonic functions a long time ago, which is why the motion is designated as such. Among harmonic oscillations, those with no friction or other external forces,</description>

      <description>Kinetic Energy1 When the force depends only on the position, i.e., it is independent of the velocity or time, the equation of motion (differential equation) for the straight-line motion of a particle is as follows. $$ \begin{equation} F(x)=m\ddot{x} \label{force1} \end{equation} $$ In this case, acceleration $\ddot{x}$ can be expressed in terms of velocity as follows. $$ \begin{align*} \ddot{x} &amp;amp;= \dfrac{d \dot{x}}{dt} \\ &amp;amp;=\dfrac{dv}{dt} \\ &amp;amp;=\dfrac{dv}{dx} \dfrac{dx}{dt} \\ &amp;amp;=v\dfrac{dv}{dx} \\ &amp;amp;=</description>

      <description>Moment of Inertia $$ \begin{align*} I &amp;amp;= \sum_{i} m_{i} {r_{i}}^2 \\ I &amp;amp;= \int r^2 dm \end{align*} $$ The moment of inertia is defined as the (mass of a particle)$\times$(distance from the rotation axis to the particle) and represents the physical quantity that indicates the characteristic of a body to continue rotating. Its symbol is $I$, which seems to be derived from the initial letter of the English word Inertia.</description>
