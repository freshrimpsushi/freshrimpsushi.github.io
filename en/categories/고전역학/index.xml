      <description>Position Definition The function representing an object&amp;rsquo;s position is referred to as the position function, or simply position. Description In physics, since we consider the change of position over time (referred to as motion), position is a function of time, as shown by $x = x(t)$. When assuming a one-dimensional space, it is commonly denoted as $x$. In the case of two-dimensional or three-dimensional spaces, it is usually denoted in</description>

      <description>Overview1 Consider the case where a ball with a chain moves in the vertical direction. If the chain is long enough that the ball moves up and down, causing the length of the chain that is floating in the air to continuously change, then the total mass of the object changes according to the position of the ball. In other words, the mass of the object becomes dependent on its</description>

      <description>Overview1 In physics, mass is often treated as a fixed constant in many situations. However, there are many cases where this is not true. For example, a falling raindrop absorbs smaller droplets in the atmosphere, increasing its mass. A rocket accelerates by expelling gases from burning fuel, thereby reducing its mass as the fuel is consumed.

      <description>Simple Coupled Oscillations Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have two objects, $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, connected by two springs as shown in the above figure. Let the distance from the equilibrium point to object $m_{1}$ be $x_{1}$, and to object $m_{2}$ be $x_{2}$. The restoring force exerted by a spring on an object is the product of the spring constant and the stretch (or compression) of the spring, so the force exerted by</description>

      <description>When springs are connected on both sides of an object Let $x$ be the distance the object has moved. Since the restoring force of the spring is $-kx$, the object receives a force of $-k_{1}x$ from the left spring and $-k_{2}x$ from the right spring. Therefore, the equation of motion is as follows. $$ \begin{align*} &amp;amp;&amp;amp; m\ddot{x}&amp;amp;=-k_{1}x-k_{2}x \\ \implies &amp;amp;&amp;amp;m\ddot{x}+(k_{1}+k_{2})x&amp;amp;=0 \\ \implies &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ddot{x}+\frac{k_{1}+k_{2}}{m}x &amp;amp;=0 \end{align*} $$ This is the</description>

      <description>Forced Harmonic Oscillation1 Harmonic motion, such as the movement of an object hanging from a spring, occurs when no external forces other than the spring constant $k$&amp;rsquo;s restoring force are acting. This is called simple harmonic oscillation when excluding other external forces like air resistance or any friction.

      <description>Damped Harmonic Oscillation1 When the spring constant is denoted as $k$, the equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator is as follows. $$ m \ddot {x}+kx=0 $$ The simple harmonic motion only considers the restoring force by the spring. However, in reality, other external forces such as frictional forces also affect the motion of the object, so they cannot be ignored. So, let&amp;rsquo;s assume there is a frictional force</description>

      <description>Orbit Equation of a Particle Subject to Central Force1 A particle of mass $m$ subject to a central force can be described by its motion equation in polar coordinates as follows. $$ \begin{equation} m\ddot{\mathbf{r}}=F(r)\hat{\mathbf{r}} \label{eq1} \end{equation} $$ $F(r)$ represents the central force acting on the particle. The acceleration in polar coordinates can be expressed as: $$ \ddot{\mathbf{r}}=\mathbf{a}=\left( \ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}{}^{2} \right)\hat{\mathbf{r}} +\left(2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}+r\ddot{\theta} \right)\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} $$ Hence, separating the motion equation $\eqref{eq1}$ into components</description>

      <description>Simple Harmonic Motion1 Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the motion of an object hanging on a spring. It oscillates back and forth due to the restoring force of the spring. Such motion is called a harmonic oscillation. The functions representing harmonic oscillation, $\sin$ and $\cos$, were called harmonic functions a long time ago, which is why the motion is designated as such. Among harmonic oscillations, those with no friction or other external forces,</description>

      <description>Kinetic Energy1 When the force depends only on the position, i.e., it is independent of the velocity or time, the equation of motion (differential equation) for the straight-line motion of a particle is as follows. $$ \begin{equation} F(x)=m\ddot{x} \label{force1} \end{equation} $$ In this case, acceleration $\ddot{x}$ can be expressed in terms of velocity as follows. $$ \begin{align*} \ddot{x} &amp;amp;= \dfrac{d \dot{x}}{dt} \\ &amp;amp;=\dfrac{dv}{dt} \\ &amp;amp;=\dfrac{dv}{dx} \dfrac{dx}{dt} \\ &amp;amp;=v\dfrac{dv}{dx} \\ &amp;amp;=</description>

      <description>Formula The moment of inertia of a sphere with radius $a$ and mass $m$ is as follows. $$ I=\frac{2}{5}ma^{2} $$ Proof The idea of finding the moment of inertia of a sphere is slightly different from other rigid bodies. The key idea is to think of the sphere as a sum of infinitely many discs, similar to the method of integration. Adding up the moment of inertia of these infinitely</description>

      <description>Moment of Inertia $$ \begin{align*} I &amp;amp;= \sum_{i} m_{i} {r_{i}}^2 \\ I &amp;amp;= \int r^2 dm \end{align*} $$ The moment of inertia is defined as the (mass of a particle)$\times$(distance from the rotation axis to the particle) and represents the physical quantity that indicates the characteristic of a body to continue rotating. Its symbol is $I$, which seems to be derived from the initial letter of the English word Inertia.</description>

      <description>Definition1 2 An object launched with angle $\alpha$ and initial speed $v_{0}$ performs a motion known as parabolic motion. Description It&amp;rsquo;s also referred to as projectile motion. Typically, external forces like air resistance are ignored, so the motion is uniform in the horizontal direction and free fall in the vertical direction. Analysis Motion in the $x$ direction (horizontal) is independent of gravity, while motion in the $y$ direction (vertical) is</description>
