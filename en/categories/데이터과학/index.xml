Though only six, at a glance, eruptions and waiting seem to have a positive correlation. It would be nice if their relationship could be represented by some two constants $\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}$ such that $$\text{(eruptions)} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \cdot \text{(waiting) }$$ The above equation represents the linear relationship between the two variables as the</description></item></channel></rss>
