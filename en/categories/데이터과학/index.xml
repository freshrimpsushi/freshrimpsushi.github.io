      <description>Definition Let&amp;rsquo;s assume a data set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is given. The following mapping for $m \lt n$ is called dimension reductiondimension reduction. $$ r : X \to \mathbb{R}^{m} $$ Or more commonly in machine learning, any method that reduces the number of input variables in a way that retains as much of the performance as possible is called a dimension reduction technique. Explanation Dimension reduction, as the name suggests,</description>
