      <description>용어 The number of independent data that can change the value when calculating a certain statistic is called the Degree of Freedom1. 설명 Why It&amp;rsquo;s Hard to Explain Degrees of Freedom When you become a freshman and study statistics, this thing called &amp;lsquo;degrees of freedom&amp;rsquo; really gets annoying. Aside from being difficult and frequently mentioned, it&amp;rsquo;s because you can hardly see its definition clearly stated in any textbook.</description>

      <description>Definitions 1 Given quantitative data, A value that is greater than $p \%$ but less than $(100-p) \%$ is called the $p$-percentile. The $100$-percentile and $0$-percentile (the largest and smallest values in the data) are referred to as the maximum, minimum values, respectively. The difference between the maximum and minimum values is called the data&amp;rsquo;s range $R$. The $25$-percentile is called the first quartile $Q_{1}$, and the $75$-percentile is called</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s assume we are given $n$ quantitative data. The difference $\left( \overline{x} - x_{i} \right)$ between the sample mean $\overline{x}$ and the data is called the deviation. The value $s^{2}$, which is the sum of the squares of deviations divided by $n-1$, is known as the variance of a sample. $$ s^{2} := {{ \sum \left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)^{2} } \over { n-1 }} $$ Taking the</description>

      <description>Definitions1 When given qualitative data, the category with the highest frequency is called the Mode. In the case of quantitative data, the class with the highest frequency is called the Modal Class. Description Literally meaning &amp;rsquo;the most frequent value&amp;rsquo;, the mode disregards all information except for that singular value. Unless dealing with qualitative data, its significance greatly diminishes, making it not so important when handling real data. When viewed through</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Given $n$ quantitative data in ascending order, the value located in the middle of all the data is called the median $m$. If $n$ is odd, $m := x_{(n+1)/2}$ is used, and if $n$ is even, any values that satisfy the following are considered the median. $$ x_{1} \le \cdots \le x_{ \lceil {{ n+1 } \over { 2 }} \rceil } \le m \le x_{ \lceil {{</description>

      <description>Definition 1 A Parameter is a numerical descriptive measure associated with a population, while something computed from a sample is referred to as a Statistic. Explanation Although there can be various definitions of statistics, fundamentally, it is considered a field of study which primarily focuses on &amp;lsquo;what is a Parameter&amp;rsquo; especially in inferential statistics, a field slightly more abstract from general understanding and favored by majors, including Mathematical Statistics.

      <description>Definition 1 $$ \overline{x} := {{ 1 } \over { n }} \sum_{k=1}^{n} x_{k} $$ When $n$ quantitative data are given, the value obtained by adding all those values and dividing by $n$, denoted as $\overline{x}$, is called the sample mean, arithmetic mean, or average. Description There&amp;rsquo;s no need to explicitly explain how averages can efficiently summarize data. Anyone studying statistics beyond the undergraduate level should be able to address</description>

      <description>Definitions 1 2 Complex Definition A bar chart made from the frequency distribution of quantitative data is called a histogram. Simple Definition A histogram is a bar chart where numerical data is divided into intervals, and the frequency of data within those intervals is counted, with the sizes represented as the heights of the bars. Explanation Histograms are an indispensable visualization technique in scientific literature, especially used to represent probability</description>

      <description>Definition 1 The frequency at which each observation of qualitative data appears is referred to as Frequency. Dividing the frequency by the total number of data and multiplying the relative frequency by 100 is called Relative Frequency and Percentage, respectively. How each frequency or relative frequency is distributed across several categories is known as Frequency Distribution. Explanation Frequency, often translated as frequency in the context of physics, in the context</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Statistics is a collection of methods for collecting, analyzing, representing, interpreting, and making decisions about data. Descriptive statistics consist of methods that use charts or graphs and summary measures to organize, present, and describe data. Inferential statistics consist of methods for making decisions or predictions about a population from a sample. Commentary Below is a story beyond the textbook.

      <description>Overview In modern society, there is no intellectual who knows absolutely nothing about data. Even non-specialists with no interest can easily think of synonyms such as &amp;lsquo;knowledge about something&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;resources for communication&amp;rsquo; like data or information, to the extent that the concept of data has become universal and popularized. The following descriptions are merely attempts to define data a little more strictly from the perspective of data science. Definition</description>

      <description>Definition Let&amp;rsquo;s assume a data set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is given. The following mapping for $m \lt n$ is called dimension reductiondimension reduction. $$ r : X \to \mathbb{R}^{m} $$ Or more commonly in machine learning, any method that reduces the number of input variables in a way that retains as much of the performance as possible is called a dimension reduction technique.
