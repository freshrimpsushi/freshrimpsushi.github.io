      <description>Definitions 1 A relation $\le$ in a set $A$ that is reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric is called a Partial Order, and $(A,\le)$ is referred to as a partially ordered set. Saying that $A$ is a partially ordered set means that it satisfies the following for all elements $a,b \in A$. $$ a \le b \land b \le a \implies a = b $$ Given a partially ordered set $(A, \le)$,</description>

      <description>Definition 1 For any given set $X$, $\text{card} X$ that satisfies the following properties is defined as the Cardinality of $X$. (i): $X = \emptyset \iff \text{card} X = 0$ (ii): $A \sim B \iff \text{card} A = \text{card} B$ (iii): For some natural number $k$, if $X \sim \left\{ 1 , 2, \cdots , k \right\}$ then $\text{card} X = k$ Specifically, the cardinality of a finite set is</description>

      <description>Theorem 1 The open interval $(0,1)$ is an uncountable set. Proof The set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is not a countable set, which is shown by the absence of a &amp;lsquo;one-to-one correspondence&amp;rsquo; between the set of real numbers and any countable set. This demonstrates that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the set of natural numbers and the open interval $(0,1)$, which can be obtained as a corollary. Cantor proved</description>

      <description>Definitions 1 A set $X$ is called a countable set if it is either a finite set or $X \sim \mathbb{N}$. A set that is not countable is called an uncountable set. $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers. $X \sim Y$&amp;rsquo;s $\sim$ denotes the equivalence of sets. Explanation The concept of countable sets might not be intuitively accepted by Easterners, including Koreans. This comes from a fundamental difference in</description>

      <description>## Definition [^1] [^1]: Translated by Heungcheon Lee, You-Feng Lin. (2011). Set Theory: An Intuitive Approach: p205, 215. 1. If there exists a [bijection](../471) $f : X \to Y$ between two [sets](../1316) $X,Y$, then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **equipotent** and denoted as $X \sim Y$. 2. If for some non-[empty set](../1337) $X$, any [proper subset](../1329) $Y \subsetneq X$ satisfies $X \sim Y$, then $X$ is called an</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s say $x \in X$, $y \in Y$, and $f: X \to Y$ are functions. For every $x_{1}, x_{2} \in X$, if $x_{1} \ne x_{2} \implies f(x_{1}) \ne f(x_{2})$ then $f$ is called injective. If $f(X) = Y$, then $f$ is called surjective. If $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is called bijective. $I : X \to X$ that satisfies $I(x) = x$ is called an Identity</description>

      <description>Definition 1 For functions $f: X \to Y$ and $B \subset Y$, $f^{-1}(B): = \left\{ x \in X \ | \ f(x) \in B \right\}$ is called the preimage or inverse image according to $f$ of $B$. Explanation Though the notation is similar, one cannot say that the inverse image and the inverse function are related just by the definitions alone, and one should not confuse them.

      <description>Definition 1 A binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an equivalence relation. Explanation To put the concept of an equivalence relation in non-mathematical terms, it&amp;rsquo;s like saying &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s all the same.&amp;rdquo; While it&amp;rsquo;s not always necessary to have a reason when studying mathematics, if there were to be a practical reason for studying mathematics, it could be said to &amp;ldquo;simplify complex concepts into easier, more manageable</description>
