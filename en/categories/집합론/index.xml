      <description>Definition 1 For any given set $X$, $\text{card} X$ that satisfies the following properties is defined as the Cardinality of $X$. (i): $X = \emptyset \iff \text{card} X = 0$ (ii): $A \sim B \iff \text{card} A = \text{card} B$ (iii): For some natural number $k$, if $X \sim \left\{ 1 , 2, \cdots , k \right\}$ then $\text{card} X = k$ Specifically, the cardinality of a finite set is</description>

      <description>Definitions 1 A set $X$ is called a countable set if it is either a finite set or $X \sim \mathbb{N}$. A set that is not countable is called an uncountable set. $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers. $X \sim Y$&amp;rsquo;s $\sim$ denotes the equivalence of sets. Explanation The concept of countable sets might not be intuitively accepted by Easterners, including Koreans. This comes from a fundamental difference in</description>

      <description>## Definition [^1] [^1]: Translated by Heungcheon Lee, You-Feng Lin. (2011). Set Theory: An Intuitive Approach: p205, 215. 1. If there exists a [bijection](../471) $f : X \to Y$ between two [sets](../1316) $X,Y$, then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **equipotent** and denoted as $X \sim Y$. 2. If for some non-[empty set](../1337) $X$, any [proper subset](../1329) $Y \subsetneq X$ satisfies $X \sim Y$, then $X$ is called an</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s say $x \in X$, $y \in Y$, and $f: X \to Y$ are functions. For every $x_{1}, x_{2} \in X$, if $x_{1} \ne x_{2} \implies f(x_{1}) \ne f(x_{2})$ then $f$ is called injective. If $f(X) = Y$, then $f$ is called surjective. If $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is called bijective. $I : X \to X$ that satisfies $I(x) = x$ is called an Identity</description>

      <description>Definition 1 For functions $f: X \to Y$ and $B \subset Y$, $f^{-1}(B): = \left\{ x \in X \ | \ f(x) \in B \right\}$ is called the preimage or inverse image according to $f$ of $B$. Explanation Though the notation is similar, one cannot say that the inverse image and the inverse function are related just by the definitions alone, and one should not confuse them. Some people might</description>

      <description>Definitions 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s assume two sets $X$, $Y$ that are not empty sets are given. A binary relation $f \subset (X,Y)$ is called a function if it satisfies the following and is denoted as $f : X \to Y$. $$ (x ,y_{1}) \in f \land (x,y_{2}) \in f \implies y_{1} = y_{2} $$ For the function $f : X \to Y$, $\text{Dom} (f) = X$ is called the domain of</description>

      <description>Definition 1 A partition of a set $X$ consists of all subsets $A,B,C$ of $X$ that satisfy the following conditions: (i): $$A,B \in \mathscr{P} \land A \ne B \implies A \cap B = \emptyset$$ (ii): $$\bigcup_{C \in \mathscr{P} } C = X$$ Explanation Although the mathematical expression might seem complex, simply put, it&amp;rsquo;s just about dividing the entire set into several parts without omission.

      <description>Definition 1 A binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an equivalence relation. Explanation To put the concept of an equivalence relation in non-mathematical terms, it&amp;rsquo;s like saying &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s all the same.&amp;rdquo; While it&amp;rsquo;s not always necessary to have a reason when studying mathematics, if there were to be a practical reason for studying mathematics, it could be said to &amp;ldquo;simplify complex concepts into easier, more manageable</description>

      <description>Definition 1 For two sets $X,Y$, $$ R := \left\{ (x,y): x \in X , y \in Y \right\} \subset X \times Y $$ is defined as a (binary) relation and is represented as follows: $$ (x,y) \in R \iff x R y $$ $x R y \iff y R^{-1} x$ satisfying $$ R^{-1} : \left\{ (y,x): (a,b) \in R \right\} $$ is called the inverse relation of $R$.

For any two sets $A$, $B$, the set of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of $a \in A$, $b \in B$ is called the Cartesian Product of $A$ and $B$ and is represented as follows. $$ A \times B := \left\{ (a,b): a \in A \land b \in B \right\} $$ Explanation The reason why the term &amp;lsquo;product&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>Definition 1 A statement that is either true or false is called a proposition. A proposition has one of two truth values, either true or false. If two propositions $p$, $q$ have the same truth value, $p$ and $q$ are said to be (logically) equivalent, and this is expressed as $p \equiv q$. As a method to construct composite propositions, the following symbols are called connectives: Negation: $\lnot$ Conjunction: $\land$</description>
