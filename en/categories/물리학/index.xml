The first spectrum picture one often sees is a line spectrum like the one above, either long horizontally or vertically. However, the spectrum was not always in this form. The first person to discover that light could be decomposed into various colors through a prism was Newton.

Spectroscopy is a branch of optics that focuses on observing and studying visible light that has been dispersed according to wavelength. However, its meaning has recently expanded to include the measurement and study of any physical quantity based on wavelength or frequency.

Description The general form of a sine wave is as follows. The reason why it&amp;rsquo;s referred to as a sine wave even though the equation is $\cos$ is explained below, as the real part of the complex wave function is $\cos$. $\sin$ is the imaginary part. $$ f(x,t) = A \cos \big( k(x-vt)+\delta \big) $$ Here, $A$</description></item><item><title>Wave Boundary Conditions: Reflection and Transmission</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1058/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1058/</guid><description>Let us consider a situation where two different strings are tied together, and a wave propagates from left to right along string 1. Since the propagation speed of the wave is related to the mass, the speed changes as the wave passes through the point where the strings are tied. For convenience, let&amp;rsquo;s denote the location of the knot as $x=0$ and assume that the wave enters from the left.</description></item><item><title>Derivation of the One-Dimensional Wave Equation</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1057/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1057/</guid><description>Overview The one-dimensional wave equation is as follows. $$ \dfrac{\partial ^{2} f }{\partial x^{2}} = \dfrac{1}{v^{2}}\dfrac{\partial ^{2} f}{\partial t^{2}} $$ Here, $v$ represents the propagation speed of the wave. Characteristics of Waves Let&amp;rsquo;s assume there is a wave with a constant speed of $v$ as shown in Figure 1. Let the displacement of the point at $x$ at time $t$ be $f(x,t)$.

The original formula&amp;rsquo;s atmospheric pressure $P_{0}$ represented the pressure exerted from above the fluid.

Let&amp;rsquo;s denote $F$ as the force, $A$ as the area upon which the force acts, and $P$ as the pressure. Then, $$ P=\dfrac{F}{A} [\mathrm{N/m^{2}}] $$ Description The unit of pressure is newtons per square meter $\mathrm{N/m^{2}}$, known as Pascal, and denoted by $\mathrm{Pa}$. $$ 1 \mathrm{Pa} = 1 \mathrm{N/m^{2}} $$ A characteristic feature of pressure is that</description></item><item><title>Characteristics of Special Relativity due to Lorentz Transformation: Loss of Simultaneity</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/260/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/260/</guid><description>Characteristics of Lorentz Transformation The transformation between two coordinate systems in special relativity is different from classical transformation due to the principle that &amp;ldquo;the speed of light is the same for all observers&amp;rdquo;.

Let&amp;rsquo;s think about light (photon) moving in the plane of $xy$ inertial system (coordinate system) when $t=0$. It starts from the origin and is advancing at an angle of $\theta$ with the $x$ axis.

To say electromagnetism is complete means Maxwell finished the four partial differential equations for the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. From Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations, we learn that the speed of electromagnetic waves is equal to the speed of light. This leads us to the following two facts: Light is an electromagnetic wave.
