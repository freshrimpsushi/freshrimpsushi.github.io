      <description>Question Electromagnetism is literally the study of electric fields $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic fields $\mathbf{B}$. While studying electromagnetism, one might have wondered the following at least once. Why is the symbol for magnetic fields $\mathbf{B}$ used? It&#39;s understandable that the electric field is $\mathbf{E}$, derived from the Electric field, but why is the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ when it should be from Magnetic field? This notation might feel oddly placed, and it&#39;s</description>

      <description>Definition1 The electric current is defined as the amount of charge that passes through a given point in a conductor per unit of time, denoted by $I$. Thus, a negative charge moving to the left and a positive charge moving to the right constitute an electric current of the same sign. The amount of Coulomb passing per unit of time is called ampere. $$ 1 [A] = 1 [C/s] $$</description>

      <description>Explanation1 The electric field is a special vector function that always has a curl (rotation) of $\mathbf{0}$. From this characteristic, we introduce a scalar function called electric potential. The potential is denoted as $V$ and has the following relationship with the electric field $\mathbf{E}$. $$ \mathbf{E} = -\nabla V $$ Therefore, if we know the potential $V$, we can know the electric field $\mathbf{E}$. Since the potential is a scalar</description>

      <description>Coulomb&amp;rsquo;s Law1 The force exerted on a test charge $Q$ placed at a distance $\cR$ away from a fixed point charge $q$ is known as the Coulomb force, and its equation is as follows. $$ \mathbf{F} = \dfrac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \dfrac{qQ}{\cR ^2} \crH $$ This is referred to as Coulomb&amp;rsquo;s Law. Description Coulomb’s Law is an empirical law derived from repeated experiments. Therefore,</description>
