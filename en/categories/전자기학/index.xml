      <description>Question Electromagnetism is literally the study of electric fields $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic fields $\mathbf{B}$. While studying electromagnetism, one might have wondered the following at least once. Why is the symbol for magnetic fields $\mathbf{B}$ used? It&#39;s understandable that the electric field is $\mathbf{E}$, derived from the Electric field, but why is the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ when it should be from Magnetic field? This notation might feel oddly placed, and it&#39;s</description>

      <description>Overview1 The scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are called retarded potentials, and they are as follows. $$ \begin{align*} V(\mathbf{r},\ t) &amp;amp;= \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \int \dfrac{ \rho (\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\ t_{r}) }{ \cR } d\tau^{\prime} \\[1em] \mathbf{A}( \mathbf{r},\ t) &amp;amp;= \dfrac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \int \dfrac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\ t_{r})}{\cR}d\tau^{\prime} \end{align*} $$ Here, $t_{r}$ is the retarded time.

      <description>Definition1 The electric current is defined as the amount of charge that passes through a given point in a conductor per unit of time, denoted by $I$. Thus, a negative charge moving to the left and a positive charge moving to the right constitute an electric current of the same sign. The amount of Coulomb passing per unit of time is called ampere. $$ 1 [A] = 1 [C/s] $$</description>

      <description>Explanation1 In electrostatics, the electric field is easily handled by using a property called $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0}$ to define the scalar potential $V$. Similarly, in magnetostatics, the vector potential $A$ is defined and used by utilizing a property called $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$. Let&amp;rsquo;s say the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is the curl of some vector $\mathbf{A}$. $$ \mathbf{B}=\nabla \times \mathbf{A} $$ Since the divergence of a curl</description>

      <description>Definition1 A moving charge (current) creates a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ around it. The force experienced by a charge $Q$ moving at velocity $\mathbf{v}$ in a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is given by: $$ \begin{equation} \mathbf{F}_{m}=Q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) \end{equation} $$ This force is called the magnetic force, and the above formula is known as the Lorentz force law.

      <description>Definition1 A steady current refers to the flow of charge that continues without changing in amount or direction. Description Since the current does not change over time, the magnetic field created by the steady current also does not change over time. The &amp;lsquo;direction of progress&amp;rsquo; mentioned here is a different concept from the direction of a vector we commonly think of. It means that as long as the flow continues</description>

      <description>Multiple Expansion When a distribution of charges is viewed from sufficiently far away, it appears almost as though it were a point charge. In other words, if the total charge of the charge distribution is $Q$, it would feel as if there&amp;rsquo;s a single point charge with charge $Q$ when viewed from afar. This means that the potential can be approximated as $\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \dfrac{Q}{r}$. But if the total charge is</description>

      <description>Explanation1 The electric field is a special vector function that always has a curl (rotation) of $\mathbf{0}$. From this characteristic, we introduce a scalar function called electric potential. The potential is denoted as $V$ and has the following relationship with the electric field $\mathbf{E}$. $$ \mathbf{E} = -\nabla V $$ Therefore, if we know the potential $V$, we can know the electric field $\mathbf{E}$. Since the potential is a scalar</description>

      <description>정리 Electric Field&amp;rsquo;s Curl is always $\mathbf{0}$. $$ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0} $$ Proof1 We will derive a general result from the special case where a point charge is located at the origin. The electric field due to a point charge at a distance of $r$ from the origin is as follows. $$ \mathbf{E}=\dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} } \dfrac{q}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} $$ If we perform a path integral of the</description>

      <description>Definition1 The flux of an electric field $\mathbf{E}$ passing through a surface $\mathcal S$ is defined as follows. $$ \Phi_{E} \equiv \int_{\mathcal S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} $$ Let&amp;rsquo;s consider $\mathcal{S}$ as some closed surface. Let the total charge inside the closed surface be $Q_{\text{in}}$. Then, the following equation holds. $$ \oint_{\mathcal{S}} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}}Q_{\mathrm{in}} $$ This is known as Gauss&amp;rsquo;s law. Flux Flux, or flux density, refers to</description>

      <description>Coulomb&amp;rsquo;s Law1 The force exerted on a test charge $Q$ placed at a distance $\cR$ away from a fixed point charge $q$ is known as the Coulomb force, and its equation is as follows. $$ \mathbf{F} = \dfrac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \dfrac{qQ}{\cR ^2} \crH $$ This is referred to as Coulomb&amp;rsquo;s Law.
