While studying electromagnetism, one might have wondered the following at least once. Why is the symbol for magnetic fields $\mathbf{B}$ used? It's understandable that the electric field is $\mathbf{E}$, derived from the Electric field, but why is the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ when it should be from Magnetic field?

This means that many electrons are not bound to any particular nucleus and freely roam the interior of the conductor. Conversely, in dielectrics or insulators, the situation is different. All electrons are bound to specific atoms (molecules). While they can move slightly within the molecule, they cannot move freely like free charges. An example of this slight movement is polarization.</description></item><item><title>Steady Current and Biot-Savart Law</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/899/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/899/</guid><description>Definition1 A steady current refers to the flow of charge that continues without changing in amount or direction.
