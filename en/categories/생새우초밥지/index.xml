In this course, instead of introducing difficult and complex new content, we will present examples where the form of equations that repeatedly appear throughout the history of science has swallowed intuition.

Therefore, we have prepared a menu related to names today. Menu Trigonometric Functions Trigonometric functions are some of the most encountered functions when studying STEM fields. However, not many may be well-versed with their names. As I recall, I first learned about them in middle school, but perhaps because</description></item><item><title>2021 Reader Major Survey Results</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/2351/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/2351/</guid><description>Reader Survey Results The Shrimp Sushi House aims to be the largest formal science blog in the country, and in 2022, we are preparing events such as small competitions in conjunction with the community.
