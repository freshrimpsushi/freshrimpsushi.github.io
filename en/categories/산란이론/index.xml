      <description>Explanation1 The canonical problem of scattering theory is, given the incident field $u^{i}$, to find the scattered field $u^{s}$ in the situation where the total field is as per $u = u^{i} + u^{s}$. For acoustic waves, it is assumed that the incident field is given as the following time-harmonic plane wave. $$ u^{i} (x,t) = e^{i(k x\cdot d - \omega t)},\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^{3} $$ Here, $k = \dfrac{\omega}{c_{0}}$ denotes</description>

      <description>Definition1 Let&amp;rsquo;s refer to $u$ as a time-harmonic wave. The following condition is known as the Sommerfeld radiation condition. $$ \lim \limits_{r \to \infty} r \left( \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial r} - ik u \right) = 0 $$ Explanation The Sommerfeld radiation condition is a criterion that physically feasible solutions of the Helmholtz equation must satisfy. It was proposed by the German physicist Sommerfeld in his 1912 paper Die greensche Funktion der</description>

      <description>Explanation1 What is Scattering Theory? Scattering theory studies the effects that an inhomogeneous medium has on incoming particles or waves. It explains why the sky is blue and Rutherford&amp;rsquo;s alpha particle scattering experiment, and is also applied in medical imaging technologies such as tomography. Problems Addressed Scattering theory can broadly be divided into quantum scattering theory and classical scattering theory. A fundamental problem in classical scattering theory involves &amp;ldquo;boundaries with</description>
