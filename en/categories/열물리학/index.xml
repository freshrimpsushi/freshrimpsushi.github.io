      <description>Definition The quantity $S$ is defined as entropy if it satisfies the following equation. $$ dS = {{ \delta Q_{\text{rev} } } \over { T }} $$ Explanation Entropy is a physical quantity representing &amp;lsquo;disorder,&amp;rsquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s challenging to understand why it indicates disorder just by looking at its mathematical definition. Explanations for non-specialists like &amp;lsquo;messing up a room&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;dropping ink into a glass of water&amp;rsquo; can only explain</description>

      <description>Laws Clausius: There is no process that transfers heat from a colder body to a hotter body by itself. Kelvin: A process that converts all heat into work is impossible. Explanation The statements by German physicist Clausius and British physicist Kelvin on the Second Law of Thermodynamics are equivalent to each other. The most famous version is by the Greek mathematician Carathéod</description>

      <description>Laws When work $W$ is applied to a system with thermal energy $Q$, the following equation holds for the internal energy $U$: $$ d U = \delta Q + \delta W $$ $\delta$ indicates an inexact differential. Explanation Since they do not have a primitive function in a clean form, it is necessary to calculate through line integration. It means that it is impossible to know exactly how much the</description>

      <description>Definition1 2 Let&amp;rsquo;s assume there is a system with energy $E$. When the number of microstates for $E$ is denoted as $\Omega (E) = \Omega$, then $$ \dfrac{1}{k_{B} T} := \dfrac{d \ln ( \Omega )}{d E } $$ defines the temperature of the system as $T$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. Microstates and Macrostates In statistical mechanics, the concepts of a system&amp;rsquo;s Macrostate and Microstate could be similar to</description>

      <description>Formulas The following equation is referred to as Stirling&amp;rsquo;s formula. $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} {{n!} \over {e^{n \ln n - n} \sqrt{ 2 \pi n} }} = 1 $$ Description1 This approximation is useful in the aspect of calculating factorials for large numbers. In fields like thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to assume a large number of molecules, $$ \begin{align*} n! &amp;amp;\approx \sqrt{2\pi n}\left( \dfrac{n}{e} \right)^{n} \\[0.6em] \log_{2} n!</description>

      <description>Formulas1 Let&amp;rsquo;s denote the number of molecules of a gas as $N$, volume as $V$, pressure as $p$, and absolute temperature as $T$. Then, the following equation holds, and this is called the ideal gas equation. $$ pV = N k_{B} T $$ Here, $k_{B} = 1.3807 \times 10^{-23} J / K$ is called the Boltzmann constant. Description Historically, it was derived from experimental laws and later derived mathematically from</description>
