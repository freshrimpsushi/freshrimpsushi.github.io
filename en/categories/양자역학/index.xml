      <description>Generalization of Vectors Linear Algebra might be a new concept for science students who haven&amp;rsquo;t studied it yet. To them, a vector refers to a physical quantity with magnitude and direction, representing a point in 3-dimensional space, often denoted as $\vec{x} = (x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3})$. This definition is sufficient for studying classical mechanics and electromagnetism. However, in quantum mechanics, concepts like Fourier Analysis, Inner Product of Functions emerge, making it</description>

      <description>🚧 이 포스트는 아직 이관 작업이 완료되지 않았습니다 🚧 Reflection Coefficients and Transmission Coefficients The reflection coefficient (reflectivity) and transmission coefficient (transmissibility) of a wave function can be represented as follows: $$ R=\left| \frac{j_{ref}}{j_{inc}} \right|,\quad T=\left| \frac{j_{trans}}{j_{inc}}\right| $$ Here, $j$ is the probability flow. $inc$ refers to the incident $(\mathrm{incident})$. $R$, and $ref$ represent the reflected</description>

      <description>Wave Function The wave function is a function in quantum mechanics that represents the motion state of a particle depending on time and position. It is usually denoted by $u$, $\psi$, $\Psi$. In the context of Shrimp Sushi Restaurant, the wave function regarding position and time is denoted by $\psi (x,t)$, and the wave function regarding position, independent of time, is denoted by $u(x)$. Probabilistic Interpretation The method of understanding</description>
