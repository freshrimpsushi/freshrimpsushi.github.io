      <description>Overview Time-independent Schrödinger equation $$ H\psi=\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{ d ^{2} }{ d x^{2} }+V\right)\psi=E\psi \\ H\psi=\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V\right)\psi=E\psi $$ Time-dependent Schrödinger equation $$ i\hbar\frac{ \partial \psi}{ \partial t}=\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{ \partial ^{2} }{\partial x^{2} }+V\right)\psi \\ i\hbar\frac{ \partial \psi}{ \partial t}=\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V\right)\psi $$ The Schrödinger equation refers</description>

      <description>Definition For two operators $A, B$, $AB - BA$ is defined as the commutator of $A, B$ as follows. $$ [A,B]=AB-BA $$ Explanation When first encountering the definition of a commutator, one might wonder why it is not $AB - BA = 0$. However, since operators can be represented as matrices, and the multiplication of two matrices does not obey the commutative law, different results can appear depending on the</description>

      <description>Generalization of Vectors Linear Algebra might be a new concept for science students who haven&amp;rsquo;t studied it yet. To them, a vector refers to a physical quantity with magnitude and direction, representing a point in 3-dimensional space, often denoted as $\vec{x} = (x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3})$. This definition is sufficient for studying classical mechanics and electromagnetism. However, in quantum mechanics, concepts like Fourier Analysis, Inner Product of Functions emerge, making it</description>

      <description>🚧 이 포스트는 아직 이관 작업이 완료되지 않았습니다 🚧 Reflection Coefficients and Transmission Coefficients The reflection coefficient (reflectivity) and transmission coefficient (transmissibility) of a wave function can be represented as follows: $$ R=\left| \frac{j_{ref}}{j_{inc}} \right|,\quad T=\left| \frac{j_{trans}}{j_{inc}}\right| $$ Here, $j$ is the probability flow. $inc$ refers to the incident $(\mathrm{incident})$. $R$, and $ref$ represent the reflected</description>

      <description>Wave Function The wave function is a function in quantum mechanics that represents the motion state of a particle depending on time and position. It is usually denoted by $u$, $\psi$, $\Psi$. In the context of Shrimp Sushi Restaurant, the wave function regarding position and time is denoted by $\psi (x,t)$, and the wave function regarding position, independent of time, is denoted by $u(x)$.

      <description>Definition Raising Operator: $L_+ \equiv L_{x} + iL_{y}$ Lowering Operator: $L_- \equiv L_{x} - iL_{y}$, i.e., $(L_-)^{\ast}=L_+$ Explanation Why are these two operators named &amp;lsquo;raising&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;lowering&amp;rsquo;? It&amp;rsquo;s because when applied to the simultaneous eigenfunction of the square of the angular momentum magnitude and an angular momentum component, it raises or lowers the state of the eigenfunction. This can be seen in Finding the Eigenvalues of the Square of Angular</description>

      <description>Definition In quantum mechanics, a wave function is a vector and is fundamentally treated as a column vector. Column vectors are denoted by a right single arrow bracket, and this is called a ket vector. $$ \psi = \ket{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{1} \\ \psi_{2} \\ \vdots \\ \psi_{n} \end{pmatrix} $$ The conjugate transpose matrix of $\ket{\psi}$ is denoted by a left single arrow bracket and is called a bra vector.</description>

      <description>Buildup In mathematics, what is called a function is a relationship that maps exactly one element of some set $X$ to an element of another set $Y$, and it is commonly denoted by $f$, following the first letter of the word function. If we consider a function that maps an element $x$ of the set $X$ to an element $y$ of the set $Y$, we denote it as follows. $$</description>
