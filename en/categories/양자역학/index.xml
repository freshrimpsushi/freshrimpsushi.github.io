Faraday had conducted a study on the spectrum of sodium and magnetic fields in 1860 but failed to yield any significant results. Zeeman also undertook similar research but similarly did not achieve new results and forgot about it for a while.</description></item><item><title>Angular Momentum and the Exchange Relation of Position/Momentum</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1636/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1636/</guid><description>Formulas The commutator of angular momentum and position is as follows. $$ \begin{align*} [L_{z}, x] &amp;amp;= \i \hbar y \\ [L_{z}, y] &amp;amp;= -\i \hbar x \\ [L_{z}, z] &amp;amp;= 0 \end{align*} $$ The commutator of angular momentum and momentum is as follows. $$ \begin{align*} [L_{z}, p_{x}] &amp;amp;= \i \hbar p_{y} \\ [L_{z}, p_{y}] &amp;amp;= -\i \hbar p_{x} \\ [L_{z}, p_{z}] &amp;amp;= 0 \end{align*} $$ The square of angular momentum</description></item><item><title>Derivation of the Schrödinger Equation</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1598/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1598/</guid><description>Overview Time-independent Schrödinger equation $$ H\psi=\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{ d ^{2} }{ d x^{2} }+V\right)\psi=E\psi \\ H\psi=\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V\right)\psi=E\psi $$ Time-dependent Schrödinger equation $$ i\hbar\frac{ \partial \psi}{ \partial t}=\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{ \partial ^{2} }{\partial x^{2} }+V\right)\psi \\ i\hbar\frac{ \partial \psi}{ \partial t}=\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V\right)\psi $$ The Schrödinger equation refers</description></item><item><title>In Quantum Mechanics, What is a Commutator?</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1574/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/1574/</guid><description>Definition For two operators $A, B$, $AB - BA$ is defined as the commutator of $A, B$ as follows. $$ [A,B]=AB-BA $$ Explanation When first encountering the definition of a commutator, one might wonder why it is not $AB - BA = 0$.

Then, the following equation holds: $$ \lambda^{\prime} -\lambda = \frac{h}{m_{e}c}(1-\cos\theta) $$ Here, $h$ is the Planck constant, $m_{e}$ is the mass of the electron, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\theta$ is the scattering angle. If we express it in terms of energy, we get $$ \cos \theta=1-\frac{m_{e}c^{2}(E-E^{\prime})}{E^{\prime}E}</description></item><item><title>The Rest Mass of a Photon is Zero</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/183/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/183/</guid><description>Theorem Let&amp;rsquo;s say the speed of a photon is $c = 299,792,458 \mathrm{m/s}$. Then, the rest mass of the photon is $0$. Proof 1. Relativistic Energy, Momentum, and Velocity Relationship $$p=\gamma m_{0} v$$ $$E=\gamma m_{0} c^2$$ $$\implies \gamma m_{0}=\dfrac{E}{c^2}$$ Combining these equations yields $$p=\dfrac{E}{c^2}v$$ $$\implies v=\dfrac{pc^2}{E}$$ 2. Relativistic Relationship between the Energy and Momentum of a Particle $$E=\sqrt{{m_{0}}^2c^4+p^2c^2}$$ 3. By 1 and 2 $$v=\frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{{m_{0}}^2c^4+p^2c^2}}$$ Since the speed of a photon</description></item><item><title>The Standardized Wave Function is Independent of Time Variation</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/101/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/101/</guid><description>Theorem1 A wave function that has been normalized once does not change over time; it remains constant even as time changes. Description Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the wave function was normalized at time $t=0$. According to the summary above, it is guaranteed that the wave function maintains its normalized state as time changes. This is a very important fact that allows us to treat the wave function as a probability density</description></item><item><title>Quantum Mechanics: The Minimum Energy of a Hydrogen Atom</title><link>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/92/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshrimpsushi.github.io/en/posts/92/</guid><description>Theorem The minimum energy of a hydrogen atom is as follows. $$ E_{min}=-\frac{1}{2}mc^2\alpha^{2} $$ $m$ is the mass of a hydrogen atom, $c$ is the speed of light, $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant. Explanation Here, $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant defined by $\alpha = \dfrac{e^2}{\hbar c}$, and its value is $\alpha\simeq\dfrac{1}{137}$. Proof The energy of a hydrogen atom $E$ is $$ \begin{align*} E &amp;amp;= \frac{p^2}{2m}-\frac{e^2}{r} \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2m}\frac{{\hbar}^2}{r^2}-\frac{e^2}{r}</description></item></channel></rss>
