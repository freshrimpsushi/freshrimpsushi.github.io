      <description>Definition Planar Graph A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing each other. Explanation When a planar graph is drawn, the regions that are demarcated on the plane are called faces. The following planar graph $K_{4}$ has four faces $f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}, f_{4}$, and among them, the one that is not bounded $f_{4}$ is called an infinite face. Planar Graphs, as</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Let there be a given graph $G$. A finite sequence of edges is called a walk and is denoted as follows: $$ v_{0} v_{1} , v_{1} v_{2} , \cdots , v_{m-1} v_{m} \\ v_{0} \rightarrow v_{1} \rightarrow v_{2} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow v_{m-1} \rightarrow v_{m} $$ Here, $v_{0}$ is called the initial vertex, $v_{m}$ is called the final vertex, and $m$ is called the length.

      <description>Definition 1 A graph is called a Regular Graph if all vertices have the same degree. Specifically, if all vertices have a degree of $r$, it is called a $r$-Regular Graph. In other words, a graph $G$ that satisfies the following is referred to as a $r$-Regular Graph. $$ \deg (v) = r \qquad , \forall v \in V(G) $$ A $2$-Regular connected graph is called a Cycle.

      <description>Definition 1 Given a simple graph $G$. If $E(G) = \emptyset$, then $G$ is called a null graph. If $E \left( \overline{G} \right) = \emptyset$, then $G$ is called a complete graph. Description A null graph is literally an empty graph. The reason why we use the term Null instead of Empty is that even if $G \ne \emptyset$, it has no meaning as a graph. For example, if there</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s consider two graphs $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ and let $V(G_{1}) \cap V(G_{2}) = \emptyset$. The union $G = G_{1} \cup G_{2}$ of two graphs is a graph that has a vertex set $V(G_{1}) \cup V(G_{2})$ and an edge set $E (G_{1}) \cup E ( G_{2} )$. If graph $H$ cannot be represented as the union of other graphs, then $H$ is said to be connected; otherwise, it is</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s assume a directed graph $G$ is given. If an edge $vw$ exists, we say that the edge leaves from $v$ and enters into $w$. The number of edges entering vertex $v$ is called the Indegree and is denoted as $\deg^{-} (v)$. The number of edges leaving vertex $v$ is called the Outdegree and is denoted as $\deg^{+}(v)$. A vertex that is $\deg^{-} (v) = 0$ is called</description>

      <description>Definitions 1 A set comprising vertices and lines connecting vertices is called a graph or a network. Let&amp;rsquo;s denote the set of vertices as $V$ and the set of lines as $E$. Elements of $V(G) := V$ are called vertices or nodes of $G$. Elements of $E(G) := E$ are called edges or links of $G$. An edge that connects to the same vertex is called a loop. If two</description>
