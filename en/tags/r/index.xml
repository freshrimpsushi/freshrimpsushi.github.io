      <description>Definition 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s say $\left\{ Y_{t} \right\}_{t=1}^{n}$ is a stochastic process. $\mu_{t} := E ( Y_{t} )$ is called the mean function. The following defined $\gamma_{ t , s }$ is called the autocovariance function. $$ \gamma_{t , s} : = \text{cov} ( Y_{t} , Y_{s} ) = E ( Y_{t} - \mu_{t} ) E ( Y_{s} - \mu_{s} ) $$ The following defined $\rho_{ t , s }$ is</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Define operator $B$ as $B Y_{t} = Y_{t-1}$, referred to as Backshift. Define operator $\nabla$ as $\nabla := 1 - B$ and $\nabla^{r+1} = \nabla \left( \nabla^{r} Y_{t} \right)$, referred to as Differencing. Explanation According to the definition of differencing, the $1$th difference is calculated as $$ \nabla Y_{t} = Y_{t} - Y_{t-1} $$, and the $2$th difference is calculated as $$ \begin{align*} \nabla^2 Y_{t} =&amp;amp; \nabla \left(</description>

      <description>Definition The range of the random variable $X: \Omega \to E$ is called the state space. The set of random variables $\left\{ X_{t} \mid t \in [ 0 , \infty ) \right\}$ is called a continuous stochastic process. The sequence of random variables $\left\{ X_{n} \mid n = 0, 1, 2, \cdots \right\}$ is called a discrete stochastic process. Explanation The term &amp;lsquo;process&amp;rsquo; in stochastic process often makes the concept</description>

      <description>Definition 1 Consider performing multiple regression analysis $Y \gets X_{1} , \cdots, X_{p}$. If among the independent variables $ X_{1} , \cdots, X_{p}$ there is a strong correlation between the independent variables, then it is said that there is multicollinearity. Practice Initially, the very idea that independent variables are dependent violates the assumptions of regression analysis and indeed leads to numerical problems that make the analysis results unreliable. It can</description>
